# Advanced Boolean Operators
How should you go about combining multiple Boolean operators in a single search box? Or multiple boxes? 

Building upon the skills in the Basic Boolean Twine game (kategarr1600.github.io/basic-boolean/), this Twine game will walk you through all of the steps for using Boolean operators to combine all of the important words within your research question with all of the different ways you can talk about those topics. As a college-level researcher, the projects, reports, and presentations you create will build on the work of those who came before you. Others who come after you may build upon your contributions.
